# davemullenjnr.co.uk WIP

Built with Jekyll /
Hosted on GitHub Pages /
Based on [Swiss Theme](https://github.com/broccolini/swiss)


### Notes (to-do)

## JS
* Highlight the active link with an underline.


## CSS


## To-do

* Design / implement footer as an include.

* Build a project page layout that can use front-matter to inject the title / description / discipline(s) into the page design.

* broccolini has a 'writing' page which is the blog post page. See it on github for the instructions / markdown.

* Container max-width looks better at 72em on desktop screen. Test it on laptop and perhaps make a rule that works for both.

* For XL screens make a rule where if min-width is "x", make container 72em (instead of 64em)
