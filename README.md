### Notes (to-do)

## JS
* Highlight the active link with an underline.


## css


## To-do
* Put project image into work page.
â€” Use srcset to define 2 versions of the images that will be served on the site.
1x ~500px
2x ~1000px
The fallback src should be the smaller version.

_Important: Notice that in the img element the srcset attribute should be placed before the src attribute. Otherwise, the browser will download the src image first and then, if it finds a better image in the srcset, it will download this one as well. This way we would end up with two images._

* Design the project template page.
* Footer.
