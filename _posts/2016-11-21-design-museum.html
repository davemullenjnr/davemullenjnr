  <p>The Design Museum invited me, on behalf of my architecture photography project <a class="link-body" href="https://geometryclub.org/">Geometry Club</a>, to explore and photograph their new space before it opens to the public on 24th Nov 2016.</p>
  <p>The highlight was the enormity of the hyperbolic paraboloid roof. It has been beautifully exposed so that it could enjoyed from the inside. Hereâ€™s a selection of my photographs from the #emptydesignmuseum event.</p>
