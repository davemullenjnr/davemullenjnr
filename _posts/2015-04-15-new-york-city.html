<div class="mb-3 mb-md-4">
  <p>I shot a bunch of video in New York on a recent visit with <a class="link-body" href="https://instagram.com/mismaria">Maria</a> (who’s in the film, a lot). I’ve had little experience with shooting and editing but wanted to give it a go, especially as i’d just bought a Canon 6D. I used my 50mm f1.8 lens throughout which gives it that nice shallow focus. I’ve since upgraded my 50mm lens to the f1.4 which is much sturdier and has a smoother manual focus ring.</p>
  <p>I edited the video with Adobe Premiere Pro. I should’ve used a simpler program because all the tools and options are a bit overwhelming for a first-time user. It took a few tutorials to find my way around.</p>
  <p>My idea was to make the video up of clips that lasted exactly 32 frames each (shot at 24 fps, each clip is 1.5 seconds long). I experimented with longer / shorter clips but 1.5 seconds seemed perfect. It gave the video a good pace without cutting between clips so fast that you can’t see what’s going on.</p>
  <p>The song used is <a class="link-body" href="https://open.spotify.com/track/79sv412UslJbXWRtqkSVGh?si=EsCNIUIdRbWtoRVGOKVM5A">Daydream by Beach Fossils</a>. There are a few reasons why this song works; it’s upbeat and energetic, the lyrics are relevent (to us) and the band are from Brooklyn which is where we spent most of our time.</p>
