description:
  - paragraph: <a class="link-body" href="https://geometryclub.org/">Geometry Club</a> is a series of architecture photographs that are identical in composition, giving us a unique perspective to contrast and compare the differences in form, design, and construction of each facade.
  - paragraph: The project lives on <a class="link-body" href="https://instagram.com/geometryclub">Instagram</a> where I encourage people to submit their own photos to be featured. I've featured over 150 contributors' photographs, from more than 30 countries.
  - paragraph: I built a <a class="link-body" href="https://geometryclub.org/app">Geometry Club camera app</a> with iOS developer <a class="link-body" href="https://www.alexedge.co.uk/">Alexander Edge</a>. The app helps you to line up your Geometry Club photos, in real time. It's free and available to download on the <a class="link-body" href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/geometry-club/id1185322655?ls=1&mt=8">App Store</a>.
