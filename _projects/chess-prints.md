description:
  - paragraph: I love chess but the <i>traditional</i> aesthetic isn't to my taste. I’ve been looking for an excuse to make something that’s a bit more elegant and minimal.
  - paragraph: So, I’ve started making this series of chess openings as art prints. They are printed on lovely fine art (slightly textured) 200gsm paper and are now available to buy on <a class="link-body" href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/DaveMullenJnr">Etsy</a>.
  - paragraph: The prints make for a perfect <a class="link-body" href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/1116098731/ruy-lopez-chess-opening-print">chess gift</a> for a player (or yourself), and are available to purchase in the UK, USA, Europe, and Australia.
