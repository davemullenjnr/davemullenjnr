description:
  - paragraph: I've designed a series of prints based on popular chess opening positions. Each opening has the chess notation written underneath the title. I'm a big fan of chess and initially designed this print for myself before deciding to list them for sale through <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/DaveMullenJnr">my Etsy shop</a>.
