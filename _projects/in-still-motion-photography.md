  - paragraph: Brand design for Liam Rimmington’s, In Still Motion Photography. Liam is a talented landscape, portrait, and still-life photographer from Sheffield.
  - paragraph: Working with Liam was such a pleasure and a great experience. After our initial conversation it was clear that Liam wanted something clean and minimal with a handmade, tactile quality to it. A hand lettered logo was the perfect solution to embody the desired aesthetic.
